discovered that certain Diffie-Hellman ciphersuites in the TLS
specification and implemented by OpenSSL contained a flaw. A remote
attacker could possibly use this issue to eavesdrop on encrypted
communications. This was fixed in this update by removing the insecure
ciphersuites from OpenSSL. (CVE-2020-1968)

Cesar Pereida Garc√≠a, Sohaib ul Hassan, Nicola Tuveri, Iaroslav Gridin,
Alejandro Cabrera Aldaya, and Billy Brumley discovered that OpenSSL
incorrectly handled ECDSA signatures. An attacker could possibly use this
issue to perform a timing side-channel attack and recover private ECDSA
keys. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2019-1547)

Guido Vranken discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly performed the x86_64
Montgomery squaring procedure. While unlikely, a remote attacker could
possibly use this issue to recover private keys. This issue only affected
Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2019-1551)

Bernd Edlinger discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain
decryption functions. In certain scenarios, a remote attacker could
possibly use this issue to perform a padding oracle attack and decrypt
traffic. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2019-1563)

						Description: "Normally in OpenSSL EC groups always have a co-factor present and this is used in side channel resistant code paths. However, in some cases, it is possible to construct a group using explicit parameters (instead of using a named curve). In those cases it is possible that such a group does not have the cofactor present. This can occur even where all the parameters match a known named curve. If such a curve is used then OpenSSL falls back to non-side channel resistant code paths which may result in full key recovery during an ECDSA signature operation. In order to be vulnerable an attacker would have to have the ability to time the creation of a large number of signatures where explicit parameters with no co-factor present are in use by an application using libcrypto. For the avoidance of doubt libssl is not vulnerable because explicit parameters are never used. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k).

						Description: "Crossbeam is a set of tools for concurrent programming. In crossbeam-channel before version 0.4.4, the bounded channel incorrectly assumes that `Vec::from_iter` has allocated capacity that same as the number of iterator elements. `Vec::from_iter` does not actually guarantee that and may allocate extra memory. The destructor of the `bounded` channel reconstructs `Vec` from the raw pointer based on the incorrect assumes described above. This is unsound and causing deallocation with the incorrect capacity when `Vec::from_iter` has allocated different sizes with the number of iterator elements. This has been fixed in crossbeam-channel 0.4.4.",
